This project allows you to automate WhatsApp messaging using a headless Chrome browser instance. It uses the WhatsApp web interface to interact with the messaging service, allowing you to send and receive messages.

Integrating [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com) with [whatsapp-web.js](https://wwebjs.dev) would allow you to add an AI-powered chatbot to your WhatsApp automation. ChatGPT is a large language model trained on vast amounts of text data, and it can generate natural language responses to a wide range of user queries.

By combining these two tools, you could create a web app that enables users to interact with your business or organization via WhatsApp. For example, a customer service chatbot that uses ChatGPT could answer frequently asked questions, provide personalized recommendations, and help users troubleshoot issues. whatsapp-web.js would handle the actual messaging, while ChatGPT would provide the intelligent responses.

Overall, this integration has the potential to enhance your WhatsApp automation capabilities and provide a more engaging and helpful user experience for your customers.
